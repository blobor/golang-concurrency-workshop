# Race Detector

Data races are among the most common and hardest to debug types of bugs in concurrent systems. A data race occurs when two goroutines access the same variable concurrently and at least one of the accesses is a write. See the The Go Memory Model for details.

Here is an example of a data race that can lead to crashes and memory corruption:

```golang
func main() {
	c := make(chan bool)
	m := make(map[string]string)
	go func() {
		m["1"] = "a" // First conflicting access.
		c <- true
	}()
	m["2"] = "b" // Second conflicting access.
	<-c
	for k, v := range m {
		fmt.Println(k, v)
	}
}
```

To run example code with race detector, try this:
```bash
go run --race 05-race-detector/counter.go
```
